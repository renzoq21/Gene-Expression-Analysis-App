This Shiny app provides a comprehensive tool to explore gene expression data. It allows users to load and visualize sample information, analyze counts matrices, and explore differential expression results using RNASeq data.

Dataset Information
The app supports various RNASeq gene expression datasets, including but not limited to:

Soybean Cotyledon Gene Expression Across Development
Gene expression data for soybean cotyledons across different stages after planting.

Post-mortem Huntington’s Disease Prefrontal Cortex
Gene expression profiling in human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from patients with Huntington’s Disease compared with neurologically healthy controls.

Transcriptional Reversion of Cardiac Myocyte Fate
Gene expression analysis in murine cardiac tissue during cardiac regeneration.

Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Plasticity in a Thermally Varying Environment
RNASeq gene expression data from Drosophila melanogaster exposed to fluctuating temperatures.

Custom Dataset
Users can input their own gene expression datasets with at least 6 samples and 5,000 genes, along with publication references.

Each dataset contains a normalized counts matrix and sample information for further analysis.
